# focus-community-components

## Why

Some components which built by the `focus-community` are great.
It would be a good thing to share them with the whole community even it these components are __project specific__. 


## How to add a component

- [ ] Create a directory for yout component(s) in `src` directory
- [ ] Add a `index.js` with your major component
- [ ] Add a `style` file in the same directory
- [ ] Add a `README.md` file with a description of your component, the use case, your choices, the props, the state
- [ ] Add one or two screenshots of your component in action
- [ ] Add a message in the `focus-community` slack to tell everybody that you just add a component
- [ ] Open a Pull Request on this repository
